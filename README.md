# RedditImageDisplay


An Andorid app that uses http://reddit.com/r/earthporn as a source to collect images used in a widget for the user to place where they
like on their home screen.

The original idea was just to cycle the images through the widget, but the app could be extended so the user has control over
which images are displayed and perhaps change the subreddit.
